# semantic-file-organizer
Semantic File Organizer is a Python-based pipeline for semantically classifying chaotic file paths and filenames and reorganizing them deterministically. AI-assisted classification is used only for interpretation, never for file operations. All decisions are explicit, auditable, and support dry-run execution.
